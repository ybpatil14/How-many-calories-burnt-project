# Predict-the-Number-of-Calories-Burnt-During-Physical-Activities.

The project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activities
based on various input features such as heart rate, exercise duration, body temperature, age, and gender. The goal is to
create an accurate and reliable prediction system that can help individuals monitor their calorie expenditure during workouts
and daily activities.


key steps :
1. Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset containing records of individuals' heart rate, exercise duration, body
temperature, age, gender, and corresponding calorie burn measurements during different physical activities.
2. Feature Engineering: Process and preprocess the data, perform feature engineering to extract relevant information,
and handle any missing or noisy data.
3. Model Selection: Explore and select appropriate machine learning algorithms, such as regression models, that can
effectively predict calorie burn based on the provided features.
4. Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed dataset, employing techniques like cross-validation
to ensure robustness.
